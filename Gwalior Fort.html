    <h1 align="center">Gwalior fort</h1>
    <div class="p1">
        <p>Built in 6th century, The modern-day fort, consisting a defensive structure and two palaces was built by King
            Man Singh Tomar,[1] later renovated by Scindia ruler under the Supervision of General Sardar Surve in 1916.
            The Gwalior Fort commonly known as the Gwāliiyar Qila, is a hill fort near Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, India.
            The fort has existed at least since the 10th century, and the inscriptions and monuments found within what
            is now the fort campus indicate that it may have existed as early as the beginning of the 6th century. The
            modern-day fort, embodying a defensive structure and two palaces was built by the Tomar Rajput[2] ruler Man
            Singh Tomar.[1] The fort has been administered by a number of different rulers in its history.
            The present-day fort consists of a defensive structure and two main palaces, "Man Mandir" and Gujari Mahal,
            built by Tomar Rajput ruler Man Singh Tomar (reigned 1486–1516 CE), the latter one for his wife, Queen
            Mrignayani.[1] The second oldest record of "zero" in the world was found in a small temple (the stone
            inscription has the second oldest record of the numeric zero symbol having a place value as in the modern
            decimal notation), which is located on the way to the top. The inscription is around 1500 years old.
