            Elevation – 1080 m. above Sea level
            Architect/ Built by – Moropant Pingale and Hiroji Indulkar
            The majestic fort of Pratapgad is famous for witnessing the battle held between the Maratha Leader Shivaji
            Maharaj and Adilshahi General Afzal Khan. The amusing feature of this fort in Maharashtra is the double-line
            fortification that divides it into two parts – the upper fort and the lower fort. The upper fort is roughly
            square-shaped built on the crest of the hill with each side approximately 180m long. The lower fort is 320m
            long and 110m wide and is secured by bastions that are 10-12 m high. The fort houses a temple of Goddess
            Bhavani and Afzal tower where the body of Afzal Khan is said to have been buried. It also has a Dargah of
            Afzal Khan.
