    <h1 align="center">Raigad Fort, Raigad District</h1>

    <div class="p1">
        <p>Built-in – 1600’s
            Elevation – 820 m. above Sea level
            Architect/ Built by – Hiroji Indulkar
            Located in the Sahyadris, this fort in Maharashtra served as the capital of the great Maratha Empire
            for
            a
            very long time. The main entrance of the fort is called Maha Darwaja, a massive 65-70 ft. tall door
            and
            watchtower. Other entrances were Nagarkhana Darwaja – that used to open up in the Darbar, Mena
            Darwaja –
            a
            private entrance for the royal ladies that led to Queen’s quarters, and Palkhi Darwaja – for the
            King’s
            convoy. The Queen’s quarters housed eight Mahals for the eight queens which are now broken into
            ruins.
            One
            can see a replica of the throne in the Darbar from the main doorway. The Darbar had an exceptional
            acoustic
            feature, where even a whisper by someone in the corner of the room was audible to the king sitting
            on
            the
            throne. Other remarkable spots in the fort are Hirkani Buruj, Jagdishwar temple, Bazaar Peth,
            Samadhi of
            Shivaji Maharaj, and Jijabai, Gangasagar Talao, etc. Raigad was a perfect example of fort
            architecture
            until
            1818 when it was looted and destroyed by the British.
