            Architect/ Built by – Raja Bhillamraj of Yadav Dynasty
            Built on the Deogiri Hills, this fort in Maharashtra is a masterpiece of defensive planning and architecture. The name ‘Daulatabad Fort’ was coined by Muhammad bin Tughlaq in 1328 when he made it the capital of the Delhi Sultanate. It was surrounded by three concentric circles of fortification also called kots (Amberkot, Mahakot, and Kalakot) which made it impossible for the enemy to penetrate. The fort is surrounded by a moat, which was filled with crocodiles in ancient times for protection. The entrances, doorways, and walls were planned with such great complexity to confuse the invaders. The top-most hill was smoothened so that no one could climb it, even with the help of mountain lizards. Other monuments in the fort include the Chand Minar, Chini Mahal, Baradari, etc.
