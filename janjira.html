        <p>Built-in – 17th century
            Architect/ Built by – Malik Ambar (Minister of the Sultan of Ahmednagar)
            An architectural marvel surrounded by the sea on all four sides, the Murud Janjira fort was initially a
            wooden structure built by a Koli chief in the late 15th century. Later the fort was strengthened and
            accentuated when it was captured by Nizamshah of Ahmednagar. The fort stands at an impressive height of 40
            feet and is bounded by high walls on all sides. This fort was strategically important and is said to have
            had 500 cannons all over. Today only a few are left, out of which three major ones are named Kalar Bangdi,
            Gaimukh, and Chavdi. The fort has 26 rounded bastions, still intact. The precinct also has two freshwater
            lakes (around 18m deep), ruins of palaces, tombs, and stone sculptures. At the gate, one can find a
            sculpture of six elephants by a tiger that portrays the valor of the Siddis. The fort was so secured that
            despite their repeated attempts, the Portuguese, the British, and the Marathas failed to subdue the Siddi
            power.
